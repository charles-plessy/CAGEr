Changes in version 2.2.0:

BUG FIXES

    o Restore the `correctSystematicG` option in `getCTSS()`.  See #61.
    o Restore object class consistency in if / else statement in private function
      `bam2CTSS`.  Fixes #49.
    o Restore proper CTSS conversion from BAM files (bug introduced in v1.34.0)
      while fixing issue #36.
    o Ensure Tag Clusters have a Seqinfo. Fixes #63.

Changes in version 2.0.0:

BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    o The `CAGEset` class is removed.
    o Accessors using plain `data.frame` formats are removed.
    o Modifier functions return the object instead of silently modifying it
      in the global environment.  Thus, you can use R pipes (`|>`).
    o Removed export function that unconditionally wrote files to the
      working directory, such as `exportCTSStoBedGraph`.  As a replacement a
      new converter is provided, `exportToBrowserTrack`, that produces
      `UCSCData` objects that the user can then wite to files using the
      _rtracklayer_ package.
    o Removed the `extractExpressionClass` function, as the information is
      easily accessible from within the `CTSS` or `ConsensusClusters` objects.
      
NEW FEATURES

    o `CTSSnormalizedTpmGR` and `CTSStagCountGR` now accept `"all"` as a special
      sample name to return them all in a `GRangesList` object.
    o Plot interquantile width and expression clusters with ggplot2.
      
BUG FIXES

    o Corrected the `getExpressionProfiles` function to accept CAGEexp objects.
    o Updated the `exampleCAGEexp` object to contain expression classes.
    o Restore paraclu support for CAGEexp objects.
    o Corrected a bug in `aggregateTagClusters` that was causing mislabelling
      of tag clusters (PR#42).
    o Prevent `plotReverseCumulatives` from crashing when values are not in
      range. (PR#43).

Changes in version 1.34.0:

BUG FIXES

    o Reform the CTSS class.  New accessor: `CTSS()` (with no dot).
    o Correct a class error when loading BAM files. (Closes #36).
    o Use the BSgenome object from the main environment if available.

Changes in version 1.32.0:

BUG FIXES

    o Update end coordinates before start coordinates in the function
      `.aggregateTagClustersGR()`.  This should stop triggering
      "'width(x)' cannot contain negative integers" errors.
    o Correct `.make.consensus.clusters` internal function.  This should stop
      triggering "Consensus clusters must not overlap with each other" errors.
    o Allow empty `CTSS.chr` objects.
    o Correct `plotInterquantileWidth()` to really use consensus clusters
      when passed the argument `clusters = "consensusClusters".
    o Fix failures on `CAGEexp` objects containing only one sample.

Changes in version 1.30.0:

BUG FIXES

    o Correct usage of `&&` for vector comparison in pairs.DataFrame().
    o Adjust to latest SummarizedExperiment MultiAssayExperiment versions.

Changes in version 1.28.0:

BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

    o The CTSS objects are now based on the UnstitchedGPos class instead
      of the parent GPos class.  Existing CAGEexp objects might give
      errors after package upgrade.

NEW FEATURES

    o Depends on MultiAssayExperiemnt instead of previously Importing it.
      No need to load it by hand (nor SummaryExperiment) anymore.

BUG FIXES

    o Correct strand in .remove.added.G private function (PR#26).

Changes in version 1.26.0:

DOCUMENTATION

    o Split the "CAGE resources" documentation into a separate vignette.

Changes in version 1.24.0:

NEW FEATURES

    o plotAnnot(): the "group" argument now accepts formulas such as "~ a + b"
      to indicate names of metadata column that will be pasted together to
      form a new group factor.

BUG FIXES

    o Prevent mergeSamples() from producing colData that cause other functions
      to crash later when coercing to data.frame.
    o Repaired paraclu support for CAGEset objects.
    o normalizeTagCount() works again on CAGEset objects.
    o consensusClustersGR() reports expression score of the selected sample
      (instead of silently ignoring the "sample" argument and reporting
      expression sum on all the samples).

Changes in version 1.22.0:

BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

    o The plotting functions send their output to the graphical device instead
      of writing it to a file.  This makes their use more consistent with most
      plotting functions in R.
    
NEW FEATURES

    o New "CAGEexp" class extending the MultiAssayExperiment class.  It stores
      expression data more efficiently than "CAGEset", and uses core
      Bioconductor typse natively.  For backwards compatibility it also support
      many of the original generic functions for "CAGEset" objects.  Sample
      names in CAGEexp objects must by syntactically valid.  Some methods
      are not yet available for CAGEexp object (see the vignette).  Conversely
      some new functions will not be available for CAGEset objects.
    o New "CTSS" and "TagClusters" classes wrapping GPos and GRanges objects,
      for more type safety.
    o New functions for quality controls such as plotAnnot() or hanabiPlot().
      See the CAGEexp vignette for details.
    o New removeStrandInvaders() function to count and remove strand-invasion
      artefacts (see Tang et al., 2013, doi:10.1093/nar/gks112).
    o Data export as DESeqDataSet object for DESeq2 with the new
      consensusClustersDESeq2() and GeneExpDESeq2() functions.
    o New "bedctss" format to load the FANTOM5 and FANTOM6 CAGE data.
    o Multicore parallelisation with BiocParallel instead of parallel.
    o New function sampleList() to help looping on samples with lapply().
    o New plotCorrelation2() function, faster than plotCorrelation() because
      it is plain black and white.
    o Multicore loading of CTSS data in CAGEexp objects.
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Example data "exampleCAGEexp", "exampleCAGEexp" and "exampleZv9_annot"
      are now is lazy-loaded.
    o NULL can be passed as genome name, to circumvent the requirement for a
      BSgenome object when actually not needing one.
    o In CAGEexp objects, expression quantile positions are given relative
      to the cluster start site.
    o For performance reasons, the positions of a quantile Q is now calculated
      as the position of the first base where cumulative expression is higher
      or equal to Q% of the total expression of a cluster.
    o plotReverseCumulatives():
      - fitInRange accepts a value of "NULL" to turn off power law fitting.
      - New "legend" argument to remove legend when set to "FALSE".
      - Axis range and labels can be modified with xlab/ylab and xlim/ylim.
      - Ladders steps start on the values instead of being centered on.
    o setColors(): allow lowercase in color names.

BUG FIXES

    o Corrected a bug that was crashing CAGEset objects when loading more than
      one BAM file.
    o Load BAM as gapped alignment with readGAlignments() instead of
      scanBam().  Without this correction, TSS position on minus strand is
      incorrect in case of indels in the read.

DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

    o Roxygen is used to generate the manual pages.
    o A new HTML vignette describes the "CAGEexp" class.

CHANGES in version 1.18.1 :

    o getCTSS() can now load data from large BAM files.  Before this update,
      there were "negative length vectors" errors when filtering out low quality
      reads from datasets with multiple dozens of millions of sequences.

CHANGES in version 1.18.0 :

    o Added Charles Plessy as co-maintainer.
    o Remove warning by replacing deprecated ignoreSelf() with drop.self().
